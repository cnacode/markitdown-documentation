# Markdown Notes
Below is a high-level description for MarkItDown project. This document includes scope of the project, its purpose, features and links to implementations with different technologies.

### Purpose
This project exists to help me keep my skills sharp. It serves a context which provides common usecases for a developer. The rationale behind it is that if a developer can employ a certain technology (for example a language or a framework) to implement these usecases he is in pretty good shape with reguards to that technology.

Obviously I don't expect to achieve mastery in a technology with just one simple note taking app and I'm hoping that this project serves as a starting point.

As a last note I reserve the right to turn this idea/project into a commercial product or service.
